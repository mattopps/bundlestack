# preliminary approach to be able to edit/edlete comments.

This is not at all straightforward because there is one comments partial for all comments.

but eiditing or deleting comments for questioons and answers have different paths

<% if owned?(comment)%>
			<% if comment.commentable_type == "Answer" %>
		      <%= link_to 'edit comment',  edit_comment_answer_path(answer, comment) %>
		      <%= link_to 'delete comment',  comment_answer_path(answer, comment), method: :delete %>
		    <% else %>
			    <%= link_to 'edit comment',  edit_comment_question_path(question, comment) %>
			    <%= link_to 'delete comment',  comment_question_path(question, comment), method: :delete %>
			<% end %>
        <% end %>


useful for testing in pry
a = Comment.pluck(:commentable_id)
b = Comment.pluck(:commentable_type)
c = Comment.pluck(:id)

d = a.zip(b)	
e = c.zip(d)
